close observation after discussion with family that the likelihood of a functional outcome for this size hemorrhage in her age demographic was very poor.\nFamily decided on DNR but intubatable for resp distress should a respiratory decline occur.\nShe was also given dilantin in loading dose.\nOvernight the patient had several episodes of seizure like activity which was treated successfully with ativan.\nShe had an EEG to further evaluate this, and was determined to be absent of epileptiform characteristics.\nOn [**5-13**] a repeated head ct was performed with was unrevealing for new findings.\nA family meeting was conducted on [**5-13**] and [**5-15**] at which time the prognosis of 1% likelihood of functional outcome was conveyed.\nThe family has requested a bit of time to think over this information before making definitive decisions toward CMO versus pursuing PEG feeding.\nOn [**5-16**], Ms. [**Known lastname 28181**] was identified to have electrolyte abnormalities that would favor enteric route for treatment.\nGiven the family's recent thoughts about possible withholding of enteric supplementation, the HCP was asked about treating these abnormalities.\nGiven these changes, the HCP([**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]) elected to pursue comfort measures only.\nAll supportive care was withdrawn, and morphine, scopalamine and tylenol were added.\nCase management was then involved with the assistance of palliative care in arranging for discharge to [**Location (un) 6159**] Palliative care facility.\nShe was discharged as such on [**5-16**]."], [4, "pt a/o x3 mae

admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service.\nThe patient had not received Lasix for three days prior to admission and again her Lasix dose was held on the day of admission.\nThe patient was taken to cardiac catheterization and in the holding area she was found to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 200/100.\nIn addition due to her elevated creatinine of 1.5 on admission, the patient had been started on IV fluid for prehydration prior to cardiac catheterization.\nIn the holding area, the patient was found to be in flash pulmonary edema.\nAn EKG was obtained, which showed no changes from the previous EKG performed prior to the event.\nThe patient was started on a nitroglycerin and nitroprusside drip with good resolution of her symptoms as her blood pressure decreased.\nShe was also given Lasix 200 mg IV to which she diuresed well.\nThe patient was transferred to the CCU for further monitoring.\nThe patient was eventually able to be weaned off her face mask down to 3 liters nasal cannula.\nShe was monitored overnight in the CCU with good blood pressure control as she was transitioned from nitroglycerin and nitroprusside drip to metoprolol and captopril p.o.\nThe patient was taken to cardiac catheterization the following day.\nThe patient was found to have severe three vessel disease in the native coronary arteries.\nVein graft angio revealed a patent SVG to OM graft supplying the distal left circumflex.\nShe was noted to have severe diastolic dysfunction as well as right renal artery stenosis.\nThe patient underwent successful stenting of the distal LMCA/proximal RA with a Cypher stent.\nThe patient was placed on Integrilin and Plavix and sent back to the CCU for further monitoring.\nThe patient had no further episodes of shortness of breath or chest pain.\nPT consult was obtained prior to discharge, and she was found to have very good functional status.\nThe patient will be discharged on aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, atenolol, and lisinopril.\nAn echocardiogram was performed prior to discharge.\nShe was noted to have an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.\nThere was mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.\nRegional left ventricular wall motion was normal.\nThere was mild aortic valve stenosis as well as moderate mitral regurgitation.\nThe left atrium was mildly dilated.\nThere was also mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\n2.\nGastrointestinal: The day following cardiac catheterization, the patient was found to have a bloody bowel movement.\nIn the early morning hours of [**12-21**], she passed dark maroon colored stools and also possibly melena.\nA GI consult was obtained and there was a prolapsed internal hemorrhoid that was mildly excoriated, but not thrombosed found on physical exam.\nHer hematocrit dropped from a precath level of 35.2 down to 27.1 on the morning of the bleed.\nThe patient was resuscitated with IV fluids as well as 2 units of packed red blood cells.\nAn upper endoscopy was performed, which showed a small hiatal hernia, Schatzki's ring, blood in the stomach, but an otherwise normal EGD.\nGI consult felt that her stools were most likely due to a lower GI bleed.\nThey recommended following her hematocrit.\nThere was no indication for urgent colonoscopy.\nPatient's hematocrit was followed throughout the remainder of the hospitalization and it remained stable.\nShe had another brownish bowel movement with streaks of blood prior to discharge.\nThe patient stated, however, that this is her normal bowel movement and she normally has streaks of blood due to her internal hemorrhoids.\nGI recommended following up for a colonoscopy in [**4-22**] months following discharge.\nThe patient remained hemodynamically stable during the GI bleed event on [**12-21**] and throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.\n3.\nPulmonary: On the morning of cardiac catheterization, the patient was found to have to be in flash pulmonary edema.\nCardiac enzymes and EKGs were followed, but there was no evidence to suggest a re-infarction as the cause of her flash pulmonary edema.\nThe cause of the pulmonary edema was most likely severe diastolic dysfunction with an elevated blood pressure of 200/100 as well as the holding of her Lasix dose for the four days prior to cardiac catheterization.\nThe patient was initially hypoxic to 80% on room air.\nPatient was placed on face mask and given a Lasix dose of 200 mg IV with good diuresis.\nHer O2 saturations quickly improved to the high 90s on face mask and she was eventually able to be weaned off down to nasal cannula.\nThe patient had no further episodes of pulmonary edema, and she was restarted on a dose of Lasix of 20 mg p.o.\nq.d.\nprior to hospital discharge.\nPatient was found to have good ambulating O2 saturations also prior to discharge."], [2, "pt will remain mech ventilated at this time.\nPT ADMITTED TO [**Hospital **] HOSP [**8-18**] WITH
